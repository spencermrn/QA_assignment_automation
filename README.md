I created a suggestion script for the automation of a weather web app using Python and Robot Framework.
I have a file named "locator.robot" that contains the selectors used to find and interact with UI elements in the web application or other GUI applications, where the XPaths are specified.
I also have a file named "config.robot" which holds configuration settings that can be utilized across various test cases or test suites.
I also have a file named "smoke.robot" that contains smoke tests, which are quick tests to ensure that the core functionality of the application is working.
There is also a file named "weatherwebapp.robot""" which contains test cases related to the functionality of the web application.
